I want to complete the project from start to finish using my knowledge and use it to learn and practice data analysis tools, methodologies, etc. I will begin by analyzing 1 of 8 datasets to begin my analysis, then proceed with the reamining datasets. 
By the end of this project, I aim to have a strong understanding of different data analysis methods, which tools to use (SQL/Python), and ultimately, create a Tableau Dashboard summarizing my discoveries. 

This dataset was taken from the Department of Healthcare Access and Information: https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/hospital-inpatient-characteristics-by-patient-county-of-residence
