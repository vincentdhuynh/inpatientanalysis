<h1> Hospital Inpatient - Characteristics by Patient County of Residence </h1>
With this project I aim to expand my understanding of data analysis methods, which tools to use (SQL/Python), and create a Tableau Dashboard summarizing my discoveries. 
By the end of this project, I will have strengthened my knowledge of data analysis tools, methodologies, and best practices. 

This dataset was taken from the Department of Healthcare Access and Information (DHAI): https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/hospital-inpatient-characteristics-by-patient-county-of-residence

I will begin by analyzing 1 of 8 datasets then proceed to the reamining datasets to gain a stronger understanding of how they relate to one another (casuation vs. correlation).
